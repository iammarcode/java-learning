Encryption is a process used to secure sensitive data by converting it from a readable format (known as plaintext) into a coded format (known as ciphertext) that can only be decoded or decrypted by someone who has the right decryption key. The primary goal of encryption is to protect the confidentiality of digital data stored on computer systems or transmitted via the internet or other computer networks.

Types of Encryption
Encryption comes in various forms, primarily categorized into two types: Symmetric Encryption and Asymmetric Encryption. Additionally, Hash Functions are often discussed in the context of cryptographic security but serve a slightly different purpose.

1.Symmetric Encryption:
    Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. The key must be shared between the sender and the recipient in a secure manner. Symmetric encryption is generally faster and more efficient, making it suitable for encrypting large amounts of data. Common algorithms include:

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): Currently the global standard for encryption, used in many security protocols like SSL/TLS.
DES (Data Encryption Standard): An older standard that has largely been replaced by AES due to its vulnerability to brute-force attacks.
3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard): An enhancement of DES that applies encryption three times to each data block, providing a higher level of security than DES.
Blowfish and Twofish: Alternative encryption standards that provide good security.

2.Asymmetric Encryption:
   Asymmetric encryption, also known as public-key cryptography, uses a pair of keys: a public key, which can be shared with anyone, and a private key, which must be kept secret by the owner. The public key is used to encrypt data, and the corresponding private key is used to decrypt it. This type of encryption is essential for scenarios where secure data exchange must occur without a previously shared secret key. Common algorithms include:

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman): One of the earliest public-key systems and widely used for secure data transmission.
ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): Offers higher security with smaller key sizes, making it efficient for mobile environments.
DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): Used for digital signatures, not encryption, but based on similar principles.

3.Hash Functions
   While not encryption in the traditional sense because they do not allow for decryption, hash functions play a crucial role in security and integrity. They transform input data into a fixed-size string, which acts as a digest that represents the data. Any alteration to the data results in a different hash, which is useful for verifying integrity. Hash functions are widely used in storing passwords securely, in digital signatures, and in other applications where integrity is crucial. Examples include:

SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm): Part of the SHA-2 family, commonly used in blockchain technology and various security applications and protocols.
MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5): Now considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities but still used for basic checksums.
